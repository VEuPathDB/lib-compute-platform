== Queue Creation

When the compute platform library is initialized, all configured queues will be
created in the RabbitMQ instance if they did not already exist.

For each queue configured with the platform there are 3 queues in RabbitMQ that
are defined as follows.

. A "jobs" queue which submitted jobs will be posted to for executors to pick
  up.
. An "error" queue which executors will post back job failure notifications.
. A "success" queue which executors will post back job success notifications.


=== Example

Assuming the config:
[source, kotlin]
----
addQueue { id = "foo" }
addQueue { id = "bar" }
----

RabbitMQ will contain the following message queues:

* `foo_jobs`
* `foo_error`
* `foo_success`
* `bar_jobs`
* `bar_error`
* `bar_success`
