Base async job execution core.

Provides a platform for asynchronously executing arbitrary jobs and persisting
the results of those jobs.

== Usage

.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
dependencies {
  implementation("org.veupathdb.lib:compute-platform:1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
----

=== Interacting with the Platform

All interactions with this platform are handled through the `AsyncPlatform`
singleton.

After initialization, the platform exposes a minimal set of methods for
interactions:

. Job Submission
. Job Retrieval
. Job Result Retrieval

.Example Usage
[source, java]
----
// Initialize the platform
AsyncPlatform.init(config);

...

// Submit a job to the "my-queue" job queue
AsyncPlatform.submitJob("my-queue", someJobID, someJobConfig);

...

// Lookup the target job.
var job = AsyncPlatform.getJob(someJobID);

// If the job is in a "finished" status
if (job.status.isFinished()) {
  // Get the job's result files
  var results = AsyncPlatform.getJobResults(someJobID)

  // Do something with the result list
}

----


The details of the queue, database, and S3 store management are internal to the
platform and are not exposed to library consumers except through callbacks.


== Job Execution

Jobs are executed by `JobExecutor` implementations provided by the configured
`JobExecutorFactory`.  These types must be implemented by the library consumer.

When a job is pulled from the queue, the configured `JobExecutorFactory` will be
called to retrieve a `JobExecutor` instance which will be executed to perform
the desired job execution steps.

Job executors will be provided a temporary scratch workspace in the local
filesystem in which they can perform any filesystem operations necessary and
store their outputs to be persisted.


=== Output/Result Persistence

On completion, the local scratch workspace the job was executed in will be
scanned looking for any/all files that appear in the returned 'persistable
files' list.  Those files, if found, will be copied to the configured S3 store
to be cached until the job expires.

All possible outputs for whom caching is desired should be configured.  This
should include error logs or other outputs that would be used when investigating
or debugging a job failure.

Directories or files in subdirectories under the local scratch workspace root
may not be persisted.  Only files that exist directly under the local scratch
workspace root will be scanned when determining what files will be copied to S3.


== Configuration

Configuring the platform is done by calling the `AsyncPlatform.init()` method,
passing in an <<Async Platform Config,`AsyncPlatformConfig`>> instance.

The <<Async Platform Config,`AsyncPlatformConfig`>> type is constructable
through a builder that will validate the configuration before attempting to
initialize the platform.

  internal val dbConfig: AsyncDBConfig,
  internal val s3Config: AsyncS3Config,

  internal val executorFactory: JobExecutorFactory,
  internal val expirationDays: Int = 30
)
----

`executorFactory`::

instances.

Job executors are defined/implemented by the library consumer and are
responsible for actually executing the job tasks.

== Database

This library/platform requires a companion PostgreSQL database that will be used
for tracking managed jobs.

The schema of the database is configured and maintained by the library itself,
thus the library requires credentials for a user that has permission to create,
modify, and delete schemata and tables under the target database.

It is recommended that the database not be shared with or used for other
purposes.

The database load generated by this library is quite light, so there should be
no issue sharing a PostgreSQL instance with other databases.

== Job Cache Management

Job outputs are automatically cached to the configured S3 store on job
completion for future retrieval.

Jobs will be kept in the S3 store until they expire at which point they are
subject to pruning.  Job expiration is configured when initializing the
platform.  By default, job results are kept 30 days after they were last
accessed, at which point they will be marked as expired and become available to
be pruned.

Job pruning happens every 12 hours automatically while the server is online,
with the first prune attempt happening on startup.
